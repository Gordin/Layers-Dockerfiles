## Environment Variables

Which environment variables are needed as replacements in config files?

### Service Config
- MS_DB
- MS_USER
- MS_PASS
- LAYERS_API_URI
- OIDC_CLIENT_ID

### Web Connector Config

## TODOs

- mount data volumes
	etc (config files + HTML templates)
	doc (questionnaire schema)
	
- how to deal with static content?
	- should we have one own volume for static data, mounted from layers adapter? (preferred...)
	- should we add one more volume in adapter data, where other containers can put their stuff?
