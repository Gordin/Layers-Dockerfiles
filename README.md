# Layers-Dockerfiles
This repo contains all the basic Dockerfiles defining the individual Docker containers used in the Layers Box. The script `start.sh` deploys a Layers Box on any Docker-enabled system. The script `backup.sh` realizes a simple backup of all data containers being part of a Layers Box.
